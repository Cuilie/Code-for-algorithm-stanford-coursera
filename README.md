## Course2 week1 Kosaraju Two-Pass Algorithm
The algorithm is designed for computing strongly connected components in a directed graph. Due the the recursion limitation of python,I must implement by the for loop instead of recursion. The for loop template is provided at coursera weekly form:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oyFlv810Ekc1QteXqDgb83vTkJEhAtnR/view

## Course2 week2 Dijkstra's Shortest-path Algorithm
The algorithm is designed for computing shortest path from one specific vertex to other vertices among a non-negative directed acyclic graph. The BFS also can be used for computing shortest path, but it has an assumption that all length of edges should be one.

## Course2 week3 Heap Implementation & Median Maintenance
Implementing the heap class with two methods "Insert" and "popmin" with O(log(n)) time complicity; using the heap class to construct an Median Maintenance algorithm, which could maintenance the median when a stream of numbers pour in. That is, when a new number come, it will compute a new median with in O(log(n)) time.

## Course2 Week4 2Sum using Hashtable
Implement a 2Sum algorithm using hashtable. This algorithm takes 1 hour to run.
